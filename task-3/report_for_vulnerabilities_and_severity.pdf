    Description: The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted. This can be due to various reasons, including an incomplete certificate chain, an expired or revoked certificate, or a certificate signed by an unknown certificate authority. An untrusted certificate can compromise the authenticity of the server and lead to security warnings for users.

    Affected Host(s): localhost (127.0.0.1), 192.168.1.47

    Solution: Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and ensure the entire certificate chain is correctly installed.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS

To enhance the security posture of the assessed systems, the following recommendations are provided:

    Immediate Node.js Patching: Prioritize the upgrade of Node.js to the latest stable and secure versions as specified for each identified vulnerability (e.g., 18.20.1+, 20.12.1+, 21.7.2+, 22.1.1+, 23.6.1+, 24.0.2+, etc.). This is critical due to the high severity and potential for remote code execution and denial of service.

    Upgrade Python Tornado: Update the Python Tornado package to version 6.5.0 or newer to resolve the identified denial-of-service vulnerability.

    SSL Certificate Remediation: Obtain and install a valid SSL certificate issued by a reputable Certificate Authority (CA). Ensure that the complete certificate chain is correctly configured on the server to establish trust and avoid warnings for users.

    Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Implement a schedule for regular vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address new security vulnerabilities as they emerge.

    Software Lifecycle Management: Establish a robust process for keeping all installed software, libraries, and frameworks up-to-date with the latest security patches.
