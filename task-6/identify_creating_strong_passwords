  ** Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords **

1. Use at Least 12‚Äì16 Characters

    - The longer the password, the more secure it is.

2. Mix Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols

    - Combine different types of characters for complexity.

         Example: M!gr@t3_T0m0rr0w#Secure

3. Avoid Personal Information

    - Don‚Äôt use names, birthdays, phone numbers, or usernames.
    - Example to avoid: John1985, Anna@123

4. Avoid Common Passwords

    * Never use easily guessed passwords like:

       - 123456, qwerty, password, admin, letmein

5. Use Passphrases

    - Combine random but memorable words and add complexity.

          Example: Sunshine!Boat@98River_Fish

6. Don‚Äôt Reuse Passwords Across Accounts

    - Use a unique password for each account to limit risk.

7. Use a Password Manager

    * Tools like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass can:

        - Generate strong passwords
        - Store them securely
        - Autofill credentials

8. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

    - Adds a second layer of protection via code sent to your phone/email.

9. Change Passwords Regularly

    - Especially for important accounts (banking, email, work).
    - Avoid frequent changes unless necessary, but do change after a breach.

10. Avoid Keyboard Patterns

    - Patterns like asdf1234, zxcvbn, qwerty!@# are easy to guess.
    - Use random character positioning.

üîê Examples of Strong Passwords:

    - T!m3T0_Secure@Life2025

    - Blu3@Whale#SunRise!88

    - Z3n!Th#987_F0cus*Now
