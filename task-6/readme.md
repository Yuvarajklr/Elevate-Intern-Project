### 1. 🔑 Password Generation

**Examples of password types:**

| Type             | Example             |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Simple           | `hello123`           |
| Moderate         | `BlueSky9`           |
| Strong           | `Pass@1234ok`        |
| Very Strong      | `C@rpet_#12!Mouse`   |

> Passwords include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and varying lengths.

### 2. 🧠 Password Strength Evaluation

**Weak Passwords**: Short, common words, only lowercase/numbers  
**Moderate Passwords**: Include uppercase or symbols but shorter length  
**Strong Passwords**: Long, unpredictable, mix of all character types

---

### 3. ✅ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12–16 characters**
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid **personal info** (names, birthdays, etc.)
- Don’t reuse passwords across sites
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Sunshine!Boat@98River_Fish`)
- Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Use a **password manager**

### 4. 🚨 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type        | Description                                | Prevention                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Brute Force        | Tries every possible combo                 | Long, complex passwords + rate limits  |
| Dictionary Attack  | Uses common words/phrases                  | Avoid simple words, use passphrases    |
| Credential Stuffing| Tries reused credentials from breaches     | Unique passwords per account           |
| Rainbow Table      | Reverses hashed passwords with lookup      | Salt passwords + strong hashing        |
| Phishing           | Tricks user into revealing password        | 2FA + user awareness                   |

### 5. 📊 Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security

- Increases resistance to automated attacks
- Expands number of possible combinations
- Reduces chances of guessing or brute-forcing
- Complex passwords are **harder to crack** and **more secure**
