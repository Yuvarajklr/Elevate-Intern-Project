** I Have Learned from Password Strength Evaluation **

1. Short passwords are usually weak

    - Passwords like hello123 or sunshine8 are too short and predictable.
    - Minimum recommended length is 12 characters.

2. Complexity matters

    - Passwords using only lowercase and numbers are easily cracked.
    - Adding uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers significantly improves strength.

3. Symbols increase security

    - Even a single symbol like @, #, or _ makes a password harder to guess.
    - Example: moon_123 is stronger than moon123.

4. Mixing character types is key

    * A strong password includes:
         - Uppercase + Lowercase
         - Numbers
         - Symbols
     Example: Pass@1234ok is stronger than password123.

5. Length and randomness improve security

    - Longer, less predictable passwords like C@rpet_#12!Mouse offer high entropy.
    - Strong passwords don’t follow real-word patterns.

6. Avoid dictionary words

    - Single words or names are easy to guess, even with numbers.
    - Combine multiple unrelated words or phrases.

7. Don’t reuse passwords

    - Reused passwords across accounts increase risk if one gets compromised.

8. Passphrases are practical and strong

    * Passphrases like Sunshine!Boat@98River_Fish are:
        - Easier to remember
        - Harder to break

9. Use tools to help

    - Password managers can generate and store strong, unique passwords safely.
